# IPL_historic_analysis
Answering a few common questions on the Indian Premier League

### Installations 
1. Python 3.0 (anaconda)
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib

### Project Motivation
As a cricket fan in India, I closely follow the annual T20 cricket competition - The Indian Premier League. As I had a lot of free time, I decided to answer a few questions that I thought would provide useful insights

### File Descriptions
1. matches.csv - The Input data that I used to do the analysis
2. what-can-we-learn-from-previous-ipl-matches.ipynb - Python notebook where analysis is done

### Summary / Results
1. Winning a toss does not guarantee a win - a team needs to play well in order to win a match.
2. Jaipur,  Kolkata, and Hyderabad are the only venues where teams batting second have an advantage. 
3. Home ground performance is key to having success in the tournament.
